📊 Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio 🚀

This repository contains hands-on, end-to-end projects built using Python and real-world data sources. Each project focuses on practical problem-solving, clean code, and industry-aligned workflows, rather than toy examples or tutorials.

All projects are developed as production-style assignments, reflecting how data work is actually performed in professional environments.

👨‍💻 About Me

I am a data enthusiast with strong hands-on experience in building structured, reproducible, and scalable data projects.

What I work with:

Data collection from real-world sources

Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

Web scraping with ethical best practices

End-to-end project structuring

Version control using Git & GitHub

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my practical skills, analytical thinking, and consistency, not just theoretical knowledge.
