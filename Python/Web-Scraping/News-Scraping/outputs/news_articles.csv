2026 Winter Olympics: Why Vladyslav Heraskevych was banned for remembrance helmet,,"Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:58:45 GMT","IOC president Kirsty Coventry visited Heraskevych and his father in Cortina at 7.30am on the morning of competition, to make a last-gasp plea for him to not wear the helmet.

She said they had a lengthy, respectful meeting – but ultimately no compromise could be reached.

""No-one is disagreeing with the messaging. The messaging is a powerful message of remembrance, it's a message of memory, and no-one is disagreeing with that,"" Coventry told the media.

""What I proposed to him this morning and to his dad - because he also said when he goes down it's blurry, you can't really see it - so I said: 'Could we find a solution where we pay homage to his message, to his helmet before he races, then as soon as he's finished racing going into the mixed zone where you can see the pictures?'

""Sadly, we've not been able to come to that solution. I really wanted to see him race today. It's been an emotional morning.""

Coventry was seen to be in tears after leaving the meeting. A former Olympian herself, she won two gold medals in swimming for Zimbabwe.

The IOC have also reinstated Heraskevych's accreditation, allowing him to stay around the Games and in the Olympic village for the remainder of the competition.

In a tense media conference on Thursday morning, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams defended their decision to ban Heraskevych.

Adams said that if they allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games to exploitation.

""There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time,"" he said. ""We can't have them all in competition with each other at the Games.

""The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes have pressure put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.

""We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.""

Adams also denied that the IOC had been pressured by the Russian Olympic Committee or government to ban Heraskevych.

Heraskevych meanwhile told CNN Sports that he is planning to make an urgent appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

CAS can hold ad-hoc committees during the Games, meaning his appeal could be held within hours of the ban.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx2dnd7g209o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Team GB's Matt Weston leads skeleton standings after two runs at Winter Olympics,,"Thu, 12 Feb 2026 11:47:27 GMT","Matt Weston underlined his status as the world's best skeleton pilot by setting the track record on his way to taking a significant halfway lead at the Winter Olympics.

The two-time world champion - Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina -put down a statement second run to open an advantage of 0.30 seconds over the field, with two medal-deciding runs to come on Friday.

Weston was the only slider under 56 seconds as he clocked 55.88secs in heat two, to add to his 56.21secs in run one on the new Cortina sliding track.

After a frustrating opening run, which began with a costly bump against the wall near the top of the track, Weston was clearly disgruntled with his performance.

But, under pressure from two German sliders, he tidied up those errors with a slick and highly impressive second run, shaving 0.33secs off his opening effort, to give him an overall time of one minute 52.09secs.

""I was quite annoyed after the first run. I tried to be a bit too relaxed because I tried to over-compensate for race-day nerves,"" Weston said.

""It's pretty crazy [to be the overnight leader] but I take every run as run one. I will completely reset myself, switch off for a bit and then re-focus on Friday.""

Given skeleton medals are often decided by hundredths of a second, Weston's fist pumps at the end of his second run were not only a sign of his elation at a cleaner run, but also marking the significance of his advantage.

Compatriot Marcus Wyatt sits seventh with a combined time of 1:53.21 - 0.66secs outside of the medal places.

Wyatt, 34, was also a strong medal contender coming into the Games but has struggled on the technical Cortina track and a podium-finish already seems like a tough ask.

Axel Jungk, silver medallist in Beijing four years ago, is in second place with a time of 1:52.39 while fellow German and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer is third with 1:52.55.

The final two heats will take be shown live on the BBC from 18:30 GMT on Friday with all four run times added together to give an overall result.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cqxdwqldpyjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Winter Olympics: How Team GB can still win plenty of medals,,"Thu, 12 Feb 2026 12:21:21 GMT","For some years, it has been said, Great Britain has been punching above its weight in winter sports.

No ice track, few snowy mountains, and yet world champions, X Games medallists and World Cup podium finishes aplenty.

But right now, those punches are coming in the opposite direction - and they feel heavy.

Many expected Team GB to be on the medal table by now, with at least three, perhaps four medals on the board. Instead, the total remains at zero.

There have been three agonising fourth-place finishes for freestyle skier Kirsty Muir, snowboarder Mia Brookes, and curlers Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, while a solitary error cost figure skaters Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson dearly when they had been battling for a bronze in the ice dance.

But it has demonstrated just how tight the margins are.

Take Muir, for example. Just 0.41 of a point was the difference between bronze and fourth place in the slopestyle.

Had she not squatted on a landing on her final run, she would have made the podium.

Brookes, meanwhile, knew she needed to go huge on her final big air run for a chance of a medal - and so she did.

She landed a competition-first backside 1620 trick - featuring four-and-a-half rotations - but over-rotated at the very last moment.

Had she landed it cleanly, she would have won a medal.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c74381y03jgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Has Jeff Bezos brought down the Washington Post?,,"Wed, 11 Feb 2026 19:53:00 GMT","Available for over a year

The paper that contributed to the resignation of President Nixon over Watergate and the Vietnam war is now having to rethink its future. The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news. When Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”. Justin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media. With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus"", we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play?
